## **📂** Branches

### **🔨** Development Branch:
The development branch is used to implement new features, fix bugs, and make other changes to the codebase. Changes made in this branch are not immediately deployed to the production environment. Instead, they are first tested and reviewed to ensure they meet the standards and requirements of the project. Once the changes have been thoroughly reviewed and tested, they can be merged into the production branch.

  

### **🔮** Production Branch:
The production branch contains the stable version of the code that is deployed to the live environment. Changes should be made to this branch only after thorough testing and review to ensure that the live environment is not disrupted.
